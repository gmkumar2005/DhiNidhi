# Auditing

Models can be automatically audited, admins can search history and view changes in real time. 
Audits are optionally persisted to the database, sent to Slack, and pushed to live activity views. 

To log your own audits, follow the examples in `NoteService`.

To view live audit activity, visit `/admin/audit/activity`.
