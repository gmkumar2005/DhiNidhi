# Code Structure

All Scala code is formatted by Scalariform, and passes all checks from Scalastyle and Scapegoat. No Scala file is longer than 100 lines, no line
longer than 140 characters, and all warnings are treated as errors. Tests are part of the main source tree so they can be run from the browser.

The project is built on SBT, and can be opened by IntelliJ directly. Plugins are included for Eclipse and Sublime Text.
